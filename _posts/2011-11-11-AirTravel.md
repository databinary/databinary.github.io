Air Travel Safety

Air travel has become an essential part of many peopleâ€™s lives across the world. The number of commercial accidents worldwide has been on the decline since 1980, even as the total amount of air traffic has increased. With the Malaysian airline's accidents and the Boing max 737 crisis, there has been a lot of concern in the media about the safety of the airlines. In this repository the concerns of the media are addressed by diving into the statistics and comparing air travel with road travel to see which one is safer. This study is based on crash and airline statistics from The Aviation safety network, Federal aviation administration, National highway safety traffic administration, and the World Bank. As a part of this study, data analysis is done on fatality counts, passenger counts, and miles data.
