Texas Consumer Complaints

Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) accepts written complaints against insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), insurance agents or agencies, and other persons or entities regulated by TDI. Complaints generally involve such matters as claims and benefits, false advertising, misrepresentation of policies, and HMO quality of care1. In this paper, the author investigates the complaints from the TDI website, filed by consumers in the state of Texas to identify the reason and the type of complaints, research the insurance companies involved, and identify the resolution time for each type of complaint. This study also highlights the insurance problems that consumers are facing and predicts the dispute resolution period for different types of complaints and in various geographical zones of Texas.

Limitations:
The author of this study retrieved the data from the TDI website and it was observed that the last quarter of 2019 had a lower number of records compared to the last quarter of 2018. This study did not make any correlation between the number people insured and the number of complained in a particular zone. This research was done only based on the data available in the Texas Department of Insurance website.
