Chicago Crime Prediction

Chicagoâ€™s overall crime rate, especially the violent crime rate, is higher than the US average. Chicago was responsible for nearly half of 2016's increase in homicides in the US. Crime in Chicago has been tracked by the Chicago Police Department's Bureau of Records since the beginning of the 20th century. In order to protect the city, Chicago police department has started using artificial intelligence to predict where crimes will happen before they takes place. Chicago crime data is available on the police department data portal. Existing crime data can be correlated with relevant location data based on the zip code or ward number to detect the patterns of crime behavior. Chicago Police Department has detailed crime data stored in their website. This data contains many variables that can be used for prediction analysis. The target variables for this prediction are the type of crime, the location of crime and the time of crime. These three target variables are used to detect when and where the next crime could happen.
